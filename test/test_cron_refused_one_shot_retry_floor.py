"""A one-shot whose fire keeps being refused retries on a floor, not in a loop.

A refused fire leaves a plain ``at`` job enabled past its time, so it runs once
dispatch is possible. Its wake must not stay at ``at_ts``: that time has passed,
so the timer would re-arm at zero delay and re-fire the job on every pass for
as long as the refusal lasts, each pass taking the store lock, merging, saving
and appending a cron-history row.

The tests tick the real ``_on_timer`` by hand and await the claim it dispatched,
then read the delay the timer would arm (``next_wake_secs`` at an explicit
``now``, and ``_effective_delay``). Nothing sleeps and no elapsed time is
measured. The refusal is the real ``_defer_cron_before_dispatch`` called from
the job callback; only ``admission_check`` is replaced.
