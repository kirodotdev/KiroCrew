"""The shared scope resolver must tell the two merge shapes apart.

``scripts/ratchet_scope.py`` answers "which files did THIS change touch" for the
merge-ref ratchets. Two checkout shapes both look like "HEAD is a merge" and
need opposite diffs:

* CI's ``pull_request`` merge ref: the BASE is the first parent, so
  ``HEAD^1..HEAD`` is exactly the PR's own change.
* A local ``git merge origin/main`` on a feature branch: the FEATURE tip is the
  first parent, so ``HEAD^1..HEAD`` is only what main brought in and the
  branch's own commits are invisible -- every consuming gate then under-scopes,
  and a violation added in an earlier feature commit passes locally only to red
  the PR on CI.

The resolver decides by asking git which parent the base branch can reach, so
these tests build one synthetic repo per shape and pin the attempt LABEL chosen
plus the returned path set. The three-dot fallback deliberately keeps diffing
from ``merge-base(base, HEAD)`` rather than the base tip: an unscoped gate has
already been observed reporting files the base branch merged after the baseline
was taken, and the CI-shape test locks that property by moving main after the
branch point.
