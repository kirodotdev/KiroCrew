"""A webhook run that a crew member's capability check refuses names the cause.

When a member's agent file was edited outside the Capabilities page, the member
session start raises ``CapabilityError("materialization_changed")`` before any
agent runs. A dashboard chat names that and links to Capabilities; the webhook
run must say the same in the places an operator reads it -- the run-history row
and the delivered result -- instead of an unexplained internal failure. These
tests drive the real ``_run_hook_agent`` -> ``_run_hook_inner`` path with a
session factory that raises the refusal.
