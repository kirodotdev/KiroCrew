"""``GET /api/members`` for a team Crew teammate the Kiro relay verified.

The roster is the owner's view of each Bot, so a relay teammate reads a narrower
row: who the Bot is (name, slug, label, description, face, origin) and none of the
owner's view of it (the DM slot, the last DM line, the member-log projections, the
local workspace, model and settings). Driven over a real loopback listener with
the relay ingress, the client-sent strip and token auth chained as the gateway
orders them, like the People, sessions and mode reads. The owner's read is
unchanged, any other non-owner is still refused, and the member writes stay
owner-only.
