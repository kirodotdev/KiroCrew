"""Which stored Kiro sign-in sessions run as, for the Kiro sign-in card.

``GET /api/kas-login/sources`` answers what the card cannot learn from
``GET /api/kas-login``: whether kiro-cli is signed in beside Kiro Crew's own
sign-in, which of the two sessions use, and whether they are one account.

A session uses Kiro Crew's stored sign-in when there is one and kiro-cli's only
when there is none (:func:`kiro_crew.lts_sign_in.select`). This handler reads the
same two stores by presence (:func:`kiro_crew.lts_sign_in.stored_sign_ins`) and
changes nothing about that choice.

What the answer may carry is fixed by :data:`_ACCOUNT_FIELDS`: an account's kind,
the host of its sign-in portal, and its e-mail when kiro-cli reports one. Never a
token, a profile ARN or any other identifier. The e-mail goes to the dashboard
owner only and is never logged.

``kiro-cli whoami`` is the one source of kiro-cli's account name and it can take
many seconds, so it never runs inside a request: the first request for a stored
kiro-cli sign-in starts it and answers ``name_pending``, and a later request
returns what it read. A read that fails names nothing and says so
(``name_unreadable``); whether kiro-cli is signed in comes from the store read
alone, so a slow or failed ``whoami`` is never "signed out".

Whether the two are one account is :func:`kiro_crew.lts_sign_in.same_account`'s
answer alone, given what each side names (its kind and portal host).
