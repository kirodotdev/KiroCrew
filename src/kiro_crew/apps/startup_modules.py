"""Startup modules: an app's ``ui.startup`` component, mounted in every dashboard tab.

The contract is ``ui.startup`` in ``docs/app-kit/manifest-reference.md``. The dashboard
mounts an app's ``ui.startup`` module on every load only while ``GET /api/apps``
reports its startup state as ``admitted``. That state is computed on every read,
never stored, so a later disable, trust change or update applies on the next load:

* ``denied``: the app is disabled, its execution ceiling is closed, it declares
  something outside the browser (:func:`eligibility_refusal`), or the request is
  not the owner's dashboard;
* ``needs-approval``: the owner has not approved this app's startup entry at its
  current version and code (:func:`ui_digest`);
* ``admitted``: everything above passed.

The owner approves with ``kirocrew app startup <name>``. The record is
``member-records/app-startup/<name>.json`` (``apps.protected_app_state``), which the
sandbox hides in every mode, beside the app's other owner decisions, and the verb
refuses a process that shows agent confinement, so an agent cannot approve an app
on the owner's behalf. A dashboard route would be reachable by any open
app page, which runs in the dashboard's origin and can call any dashboard route as
the owner.
