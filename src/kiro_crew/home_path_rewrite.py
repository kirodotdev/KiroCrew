"""Move the absolute paths an import archive carries from its home to this one.

An export from one computer names folders under that computer's home: a chat's
project (``/home/<user>/app``), the saved workspace root, the dashboard's default
project. Installed as is on a computer with another home (``/Users/<user>``), the
first session that opens one of them creates that folder, and on macOS the
volume root is read-only, so it fails with ``[Errno 30] Read-only file system``.

:func:`rewrite_staged_paths` runs on the staged extraction, before either import
mode copies anything. A path under the archive's home moves to the same place
under this home. Any other path stays only when it is a directory on this
computer; otherwise it is dropped, so the chat opens in the default workspace
instead of failing, and the summary counts it. Nothing here writes outside the
staged tree: a moved path always lands under this home, and the folders it names
are created later, if at all, by the code that opens them.
