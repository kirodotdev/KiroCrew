"""``kirocrew.chat_runtime_share.*`` -- does chat runtime sharing help, and does it stall.

The ``chat_runtime_sharing`` feature preview places several dashboard chats on one
agent process. Before it can be on by default, a week of numbers has to answer four
questions: how many gateways turned it on, how many processes and how much memory
it saved, whether a chat's turn starts later when it shares a process, and how many
chats one crash takes down. These instruments answer them and nothing else.

=================================================  =======  ======================================

Whether the preview is on is the existing ``kirocrew.inventory.config.toggle`` gauge
with ``key=preview_chat_runtime_sharing`` (``inventory_gauges.read_config_toggles``), the
way every other switch reports adoption.

**Every attribute value is closed.** Each set is a tuple below, and every input
outside it maps to :data:`OTHER`. No session key, pid, path, model id, prompt or
config value reaches an attribute. ``tenants`` is the chat lease count on the
process, bucketed to ``0`` / ``1`` / ``2`` / ``3`` / ``4+``: ``0`` is a turn on a
runtime no chat lease holds (a subagent's or a background runtime), ``1`` is a chat
alone on its process (unshared, or a shared process with one tenant left), and
``2`` and up is a shared process.

**A distribution is a bucket-labelled counter, not a histogram,** because
``product_metrics.PRODUCT_METRICS`` admits counters and gauges only: a histogram's
buckets may not survive the receiving backend. The edges are
:data:`DELAY_BUCKET_EDGE_SECS` and :data:`RSS_BUCKET_EDGE_MB`, stated in
``docs/system-specs/modules/metrics.md`` beside each row.

**Recording never changes what it measures.** ``emit_counter`` swallows every
failure of the emit after a debug log, and the bucketing below is total: every
input, including one that is not a number, maps onto a member of its own tuple.
Every call site records after the step it measures has happened.
