# *subcommand* — i.e. the first non-flag/non-option token after ``git`` — rather
# than a substring.  Mirrors the anchored regex in
# ``config/defaults.json`` deniedCommands.
#
# ``git [<-c k=v>...] [<-C path>...] push ...`` is a publish.  Intervening
# tokens may only be options (``-x``) or option-with-value pairs
# (``-C /path``, ``-c core.x=y``) — a bare non-flag token before ``push``
# (e.g. ``stash``) means ``push`` is NOT the subcommand, so ``git stash push``
# is correctly allowed.  Anchored to a segment start (optionally preceded by a
# command separator) so ``git log --grep push`` is not matched.
#
# The trailing terminator is a lookahead that accepts whitespace, end-of-string,
# OR a shell metacharacter that closes/terminates the segment — so a bare
# ``git push`` (no remote/branch, valid: pushes current branch to the default
# remote) is still caught inside ``$(git push)``, `` `git push` ``, ``git push|cat``,
# ``git push&``, etc., not just when followed by a space.

         defeats the symlink bypass: the resolved target of the link is
         ``~/.aws/credentials`` even though the link's own name is benign.
      2. the LEXICALLY-normalized path (no symlink following) and the raw

    ``sub/cfg.ini`` resolves against the real directory rather than whatever CWD
    the gateway process happens to have.  Absolute inputs are unaffected;

    redacting (a false negative merely reverts to today's behavior, a false
    positive corrupts benign output). Gates, cheapest-first:

    1. Length is EXACTLY 40 (AWS secret-key length).
    2. Contains all three of lower + upper + digit (rejects all-lower prose runs,
       all-upper CONSTANT_NAMES, base32, digit strings).
    3. Not an all-hex run (rejects git SHAs, sha256/md5 digests).
    4. Shannon entropy >= _SECRET_ENTROPY_MIN (rejects low-entropy repeats/prose
       and most code identifiers, which cluster below 4.3).
    5. Does not base64-decode to printable text (rejects encoded-text blobs).
    6. Structural randomness: longest lowercase run <= _SECRET_MAX_LOWER_RUN AND
       vowel ratio <= _SECRET_MAX_VOWEL_RATIO. These separate a random key from
       word-based identifiers and slash-delimited file paths that survive the
       entropy floor. Both gates apply to EVERY token (a '/' or '+' does not
       exempt a token, so 40-char mixed-case file paths stay intact).

    BOUNDARY ASSUMPTION: this classifier deliberately evaluates an EXACTLY-40-char
    window (gate 1). It does NOT itself scan longer runs — a real key glued to an
    adjacent base64 char with no delimiter (e.g. ``X`` + key, key + ``A``,
    ``SECRET=`` + key + ``ABC``, key + ``X`` + key) forms a 41+ char run that would
    fail the exact-40 gate and leak verbatim. Callers that receive raw ``{40,}``
    runs MUST use :func:`_contains_bare_secret`, which slides a 40-char window
    across the run so a glued secret is still caught. Keep the exact-40 shape here:

    ── Two-pass evaluation ──
    Pass 1 (whole-string): every deny pattern is matched against the
    full input.  If a pattern matches and **no exception pattern also
    matches the full input**, the input is denied immediately.  This
    closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a separator
    boundary that per-segment splitting would erase, e.g.
    ``git$(echo ' ')push origin main`` (which bash evaluates to
    ``git push origin main``): the whole string contains both ``git`` and
    ``push`` so the broad ``*git*push*`` glob matches, and there is no
    matching exception, so the command is denied at this stage even
    though splitting on ``$(`` / ``)`` would otherwise produce no
    segment containing both substrings.

    Pass 2 (per-segment) only runs if pass 1 found a deny match **and**
    the full input also matched at least one exception for that pattern.
    The input is split on shell command separators (``;``, ``&&``,
    ``||``, ``|``, newlines) and command-substitution boundaries
    (``$(``, ``)``, backticks) into segments, and each segment is
    re-evaluated independently.  This preserves the chaining-bypass
    protection (any embedded real
    publish lives in its own segment and matches the deny pattern in its
    own right) while allowing the legitimate stash-in-pipeline case
    that the prior whole-string design over-blocked.

    Edge cases & limitations:
      - Pass-1 deny is conservative: anything matching a deny glob with
        no exception is blocked, even if the input is structurally
        contorted.
      - Pass-2 splitting is purely textual; quoted strings and escaped
        separators are split anyway (over-blocking is the safer
        direction).
      - Heredoc bodies, ``eval``, ``bash -c``, etc., are not parsed
        specially.  If those become evasion vectors in practice, add
        explicit deny patterns for them.

    Audit:
      - Every denial path emits a ``deny_event`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_event``.
      - Every granted exception emits a ``deny_exception`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_exception_event`` (fail-closed: if SEL logging
        fails the exception is not granted).

    Args:
        tool_name: The full command line / tool invocation to evaluate.
        extra_patterns: Optional fnmatch glob patterns to append to the
            built-in deny list (typically from user config).

    Returns:
        Denial reason string (mentioning the matched pattern), or
        ``None`` if the input is allowed.

# below) — but all four stay operator-configurable per deployment.
#
# Why not a default-on fork-bomb / memory cap? RLIMIT is the wrong tool for
# those defaults: RLIMIT_NPROC is per-UID (not per-subtree) and RLIMIT_AS caps
# virtual (not resident) memory. cgroup v2 ``pids.max`` / ``memory.max`` are the
# correct per-cgroup fork-bomb and RSS ceilings and are tracked as future work

    Reads limits from the ``resource_limits`` config section:

      - ``max_open_files``: RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file descriptors).

      - ``max_memory_mb``: RLIMIT_AS (virtual address space) in MB (``0``

    Each key accepts a positive integer to set that limit, or ``0`` to leave the

    A requested limit is always clamped DOWN to the inherited hard limit — we

    and degrades gracefully per-limit on platforms lacking a specific rlimit
    (e.g. macOS has no RLIMIT_NPROC / a flaky RLIMIT_AS).

    NOTE: ``preexec_fn`` runs post-fork in a subprocess that may be
    multi-threaded; it MUST stay async-signal-safe — only ``getrlimit`` /
    ``setrlimit`` here, no allocation-heavy or lock-taking work.
